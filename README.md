# Project 3: Tinier Bananas

Tinier Bananas is a take on the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>, a party game where you create words/images with friends.

### Create a short story with your friends

The goal of the game is to create an absurd/funny short story by collecting out-of-context sentences written by you and your friends.

### How it works

Players take turns writing sentences with only the context of the previously sent sentence provided. When players decide to end the game, these sentences are used to form a short story that everyone can laugh at.
